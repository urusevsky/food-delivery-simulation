Restaurant Count Study: Effect of Restaurant Count on System Performance

Research Question: How does varying restaurant count affect food delivery system performance?

Building on Previous Studies:
- Study 1 established three operational regimes based on arrival interval ratio (stable, 
  critical, failure) and identified the intensity effect (baseline outperforms 2× baseline)
- Study 2 demonstrated that pairing shifts regime boundaries dramatically (from ~5.5-6.0 
  to beyond 8.0) and exhibits self-regulating properties
- Study 3 tested layout robustness across different random seeds, finding that pairing 
  makes the system robust to spatial variation

This Study (Study 4):
- Tests whether restaurant network density affects system performance
- Investigates interaction between restaurant count and pairing mechanism
- Examines whether spatial efficiency improvements from more restaurants translate 
  to operational performance gains

Design Pattern:
- 3 restaurant counts (5, 10, 15) in fixed 10×10km area
- Single structural seed (42) for focused analysis
- 2 arrival interval ratios (5.0, 7.0) sampling critical and high-stress regimes
- 2 pairing conditions (OFF, ON) to test count × pairing interaction

Total Design Points: 3 counts × 2 ratios × 2 pairing conditions = 12

PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTION:
How does restaurant count (in fixed area) affect food delivery system performance?
"""

context = """
CONTEXT & MOTIVATION:

Study 3 showed that random spatial layout variation has relatively small effects 
on performance when pairing is enabled. However, Study 3 varied layout (spatial 
arrangement) while holding restaurant count constant.

This study varies restaurant COUNT while holding area constant. Restaurant count 
could affect the system through multiple mechanisms:
1. Spatial mechanism: More restaurants could mean shorter customer-to-restaurant distances
2. Temporal mechanism: More restaurants means orders distributed across more locations

The interaction between these mechanisms is unclear. Do they work together, offset 
each other, or operate independently? We'll observe the results and develop 
mechanistic explanations.

Platform operators can control restaurant count through recruitment strategies.
Understanding whether and how restaurant count affects performance is a practical 
question with direct operational implications.
"""

sub_questions = """
SUB-QUESTIONS:

1. Does restaurant count affect performance?
   - Does assignment time change as we vary count from 5 to 10 to 15?
   - Is the effect monotonic, or do we see plateaus or diminishing returns?
   - What is the magnitude compared to other factors (ratio, pairing)?

2. Does the count effect interact with pairing?
   - Does count matter more when pairing is OFF vs ON?
   - Or is the count effect similar regardless of pairing condition?
   - What does this tell us about the mechanisms at play?

3. Does the count effect vary by load ratio?
   - Is count more impactful at ratio 7.0 (high stress) vs 5.0 (critical)?
   - Or does count have consistent effects across stress levels?

4. How does typical distance scale with count?
   - Infrastructure analysis will show actual distance patterns
   - Do we see the spatial efficiency improvement we'd expect?
   - How does this relate to operational performance changes?
"""

scope = """
SCOPE & BOUNDARIES:

Tested:
- Restaurant counts: 5, 10, 15 (3× range from sparse to dense)
- Fixed area: 10×10km (isolates count effect from scale effect)
- Single seed: 42 (controls for layout variation, tests main effect)
- Ratios: 5.0 (critical), 7.0 (high stress) - where effects likely detectable
- Pairing: OFF and ON (tests interaction)

Not tested:
- Different area sizes (Study 5 will address this)
- Full ratio range (stable regime unlikely to show count effects)
- Multiple seeds (robustness check if count effects are significant)
- Counts above 15 (diminishing returns expected)
"""

analysis_focus = """
KEY METRICS & ANALYSIS FOCUS:

1. Assignment time (order_metrics)
   - Mean of means: Primary performance indicator
   - Compare 5 vs 10 vs 15 restaurants
   - Observe: Monotonic improvement? Plateaus? Non-monotonic patterns?

2. Infrastructure characteristics
   - Typical distance: How does it change with count?
   - Restaurant density: 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 per km²
   - Spatial efficiency patterns

3. Count × Pairing interaction
   - Does count effect differ between pairing OFF and ON?
   - What does the interaction pattern tell us about mechanisms?

4. Count × Ratio interaction
   - Does count effect differ between ratio 5.0 and 7.0?
   - How does system stress level modulate count effects?

Analysis Approach:
- Primary: Main effect of count (averaged across conditions)
- Secondary: Interactions with pairing and ratio
- Mechanism: Infrastructure analysis showing distance patterns
- Context: Compare effect magnitude to Study 1 (ratio) and Study 2 (pairing)
- Explanation: Develop mechanistic explanations based on observed patterns
