Delivery Area Size Study: Effect of Delivery Area Size on System Performance

Research Question: How does delivery area size affect food delivery system performance?

Building on Previous Studies:
- Study 1 established three operational regimes based on arrival interval ratio (stable, 
  critical, failure) and identified the intensity effect (baseline outperforms 2× baseline)
- Study 2 demonstrated that pairing shifts regime boundaries dramatically (from ~5.5-6.0 
  to beyond 8.0) and exhibits self-regulating properties
- Study 3 tested layout robustness across different random seeds, finding that pairing 
  makes the system robust to spatial variation
- Study 4 found that restaurant count has minimal impact on system performance (0-15% 
  customer benefit), with effects visible primarily when pairing is disabled

This Study (Study 5):
- Tests whether delivery area size affects system performance
- Unlike restaurant count (which primarily affects driver→restaurant leg), area size 
  affects the entire logistics journey - every distance component scales with area
- Investigates interaction between area size and pairing mechanism
- Examines whether area effects are substantially larger than count effects due to 
  system-wide impact

Design Pattern:
- 3 delivery area sizes (5×5, 10×10, 15×15 km) with fixed restaurant count (10)
- Single structural seed (42) for focused analysis
- 2 arrival interval ratios (5.0, 7.0) sampling critical and high-stress regimes
- 2 pairing conditions (OFF, ON) to test area × pairing interaction

Total Design Points: 3 areas × 2 ratios × 2 pairing conditions = 12

PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTION:
How does delivery area size affect food delivery system performance?
"""

context = """
CONTEXT & MOTIVATION:

Study 4 revealed that restaurant count has minimal impact on system performance. 
Tripling restaurant count (5→15) in fixed area produced only 0-15% customer 
benefit, with effects visible primarily when pairing is disabled. The nearest-
restaurant effect (7-13% first contact time reduction) is real but affects only 
one leg of the logistics journey.

This study tests a complementary infrastructure factor: delivery area size. Unlike 
restaurant count, which primarily affects the initial driver→restaurant leg, area 
size affects the entire logistics journey - every distance component scales with 
area. This system-wide impact suggests area effects may be substantially larger 
than count effects.

Studies 1-4 established that infrastructure factors (layout, count) are third-order 
compared to operational factors (ratio, pairing). However, all prior studies used 
fixed 10×10 km area. Does this conclusion hold when area varies? Or does area 
emerge as a more significant infrastructure factor?

Platform operators face practical questions: How large can service areas grow 
before performance degrades unacceptably? Does pairing remain effective at larger 
scales? Understanding area effects is essential for expansion planning.
"""

sub_questions = """
SUB-QUESTIONS:

1. How does area size affect performance across different metrics?
   - Travel time components (first contact, pickup, delivery)
   - Assignment time (queueing + matching)
   - Fulfillment time (customer experience)
   - Do all components degrade proportionally, or do some amplify more?

2. Does the area effect interact with system load?
   - Is area more impactful at ratio 5.0 (critical) vs 7.0 (high stress)?
   - Does larger area push system into failure at ratios that were stable in 10×10?
   - Or does area effect remain constant across load levels?

3. Does the area effect interact with pairing?
   - Does pairing remain effective in larger areas?
   - Does pairing rate decline as orders become more spatially dispersed?
   - Can pairing compensate for area-induced performance degradation?
   - Or does area overwhelm pairing's capacity-doubling benefit?

4. How does area size affect spatial efficiency?
   - Does typical distance scale with √(area) as geometry suggests?
   - Does larger area interact with restaurant layout in unexpected ways?
   - Are there path dependency effects (drivers farther from next assignment)?

5. Does the feedback loop amplify area effects?
   - Study 4 showed 13% first contact improvement → 28% assignment improvement (2.5× amplification)
   - Does area degradation amplify similarly through driver availability feedback?
   - Or do larger areas break the feedback loop entirely?

6. What is the magnitude of area effects compared to other factors?
   - Study 4: Count effects were 0-15% (third-order factor)
   - Study 2: Pairing effects were ~60% (first-order factor)
   - Where do area effects fall in this hierarchy?
"""

scope = """
SCOPE & BOUNDARIES:

Tested:
- Area sizes: 5×5, 10×10, 15×15 km (9× range from compact to sprawling)
- Fixed restaurant count: 10 (controls for count effect, isolates area effect)
- Single seed: 42 (controls for layout variation, tests main effect)
- Ratios: 5.0 (critical), 7.0 (high stress) - where effects likely detectable
- Pairing: OFF and ON (tests interaction)
- Fixed pairing thresholds: δ_r = 4.0 km, δ_c = 3.0 km (tests how fixed policies scale)

Note on density:
- Varying area with fixed count implicitly varies density
- 5×5, n=10: 0.40 restaurants/km² (very dense)
- 10×10, n=10: 0.10 restaurants/km² (baseline)
- 15×15, n=10: 0.044 restaurants/km² (sparse)
- After Study 5, can analyze whether density or area is fundamental

Not tested:
- Different restaurant counts (Study 4 addressed this)
- Different area-count combinations (factorial design left for future)
- Scaled pairing thresholds (tests fixed policy across scales)
- Multiple seeds (robustness check if area effects are significant)
- Full ratio range (stable regime unlikely to show large effects)
"""

analysis_focus = """
KEY METRICS & ANALYSIS FOCUS:

1. Travel time decomposition (critical for understanding area effects)
   - First contact time: driver → first restaurant
   - Pickup travel: complete restaurant pickup phase
   - Delivery travel: restaurant → customer phase
   - Total travel time: sum of all components
   → Hypothesis: All components should scale with area, but by how much?

2. Assignment time (tests feedback loop amplification)
   - Does area affect assignment through driver cycle feedback?
   - Or is assignment time independent of area when ratio is controlled?
   → Study 4 showed 2.5× amplification - does area show similar dynamics?

3. Fulfillment time (customer experience)
   - Net effect of travel + assignment changes
   - How much does area degrade customer experience?
   - Compare magnitude to Study 4's count effects (0-15%)

4. Growth rate (system stability)
   - Does larger area push system into unbounded growth?
   - What ratios are sustainable in each area size?
   - Can pairing rescue stability in large areas?

5. Pairing effectiveness metrics
   - Pairing rate: Does dispersion reduce pairing opportunities?
   - Inter-restaurant distances in pairs
   - Does fixed 4km threshold become increasingly restrictive?

6. Infrastructure characteristics
   - Typical distance: Does it scale with √(area)?
   - Deviations indicate path dependency or layout interactions

Analysis Approach:
- Primary: Main effect of area (compare 5×5 vs 10×10 vs 15×15)
- Secondary: Area × ratio interaction (does effect vary by load?)
- Tertiary: Area × pairing interaction (does pairing compensate?)
- Mechanism: Component-level metrics showing where area effects manifest
- Context: Compare magnitude to Studies 1, 2, 4 (factor hierarchy)
- Explanation: Develop mechanistic explanations based on observed patterns
