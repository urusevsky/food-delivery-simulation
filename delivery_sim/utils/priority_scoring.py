"""
Priority Scoring System for Food Delivery Assignment Decisions

This module implements a multi-criteria scoring system that evaluates
driver-entity assignment opportunities based on distance efficiency,
throughput optimization, and fairness considerations.

Configuration is handled by ScoringConfig in configuration.py.
Infrastructure analysis (like typical_distance calculation) is now handled 
by the infrastructure_analysis module for better separation of concerns.
